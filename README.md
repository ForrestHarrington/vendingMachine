# vendingMachine
Vending machine program

My approaoach to this program was to try and be as object oriented as made sense. In this way I created utility styled classes for both outputting to an external file and parsing the JSON into their own respective classes. 
I also made a config class which simply repestends dimensions for the vending machine space. 
Beyond those the main portion of the program takes place in the VendingMachine and Product classes. The cending machine class represents the working machine, and the products class represetns a individual kind of product (IE 10 KITKATS or anything) and it's respective quantity. 

Due to covid and traveling I have not put the amount of time and effort into this assessment as I would have hoped. As such i would like to outline some further changes I would have liked to make to extend the program. I think general improvements to UI and UX are both important factors that I have not had time to put effort towards. I also think UNit testing is extremely valuable and I would have liked to include that in this assignment.
